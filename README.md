## Email-Classifier
--------

This project is to create a machine learning algorith that detects spam emails.
The dataset used consists of email messages and their labels (0 for non-spam, 1 for spam). 
The labeled training dataset contains 8348 labeled examples, and the unlabeled test set contains 1000 unlabeled examples.

The steps applied to build an optimal model include: text data eda, feature selection, one-hot encoding, logistic regression.
Final model evaluated using precision-recall and attained a test accuracy of 99.57%.

**Tools Used** : Python, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, RegEx, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
